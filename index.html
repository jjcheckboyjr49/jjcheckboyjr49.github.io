        <h3>Family</h3>
        <img src="download1.jpg">
        <p>My family is a lively bunch, filled with laughter and fun. I have three younger sisters, aged 19, 16, and 14, and we share a strong bond over our favorite activities. Whether we’re hitting the pickleball courts or gathered around the table for board games, we always have a great time together. Our friendly competitions and playful banter make every moment special, creating memories that we’ll cherish for years to come.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I’m currently a sophomore at BYU, where I’m pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I’ve developed a strong interest in the field, but I’m also considering a switch to cybersecurity, as I find the challenges and complexities of protecting digital information fascinating. Balancing my coursework and exploring different areas within tech has been an exciting journey, and I’m eager to see where my studies will lead me in the future.</p>
        
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I love staying active and enjoying the great outdoors. Pickleball and tennis are two of my favorite sports; there's something invigorating about the competition and camaraderie they bring. I also cherish spending time in nature, whether it’s hiking scenic trails or just soaking up the fresh air. These hobbies keep me energized and provide a perfect balance to my busy life as a student.</p>
